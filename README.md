(Note that the backup sending code is limited to "1.12" version of the TI-ROM @ this time)

* /devl4ti/ -> the TI92 Fargo workspace for onTI Terminal software
* /tools/   -> Java tools & utilities to send backup & PRGMs to TI via the Arduino
* /fs/      -> some content that can be sent to TI (it does not contains the used .92B because it's forbiden by law)
* /picures/ -> diagrams & photographs about the process of my TI reborn
* /docs/    -> guess ...
* ./        -> Arduino program for Serial Inteface
